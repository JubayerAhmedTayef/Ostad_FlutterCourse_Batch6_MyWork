Question: What is dart?
Answer: Dart is a client-optimized language for developing fast apps on any platform. Its goal is to offer the most productive programming language for multi-platform development, paired with a flexible execution runtime platform for app frameworks.
*/

/*
Question: Why dart is designed?
Answer: Dart is designed for a technical envelope that is particularly suited to client development, prioritizing both development (sub-second stateful hot reload) and high-quality production experiences across a wide variety of compilation targets (Web, Mobile and Desktop).

/*
Question: What relation between dart and flutter?
Answer: Dart also forms the foundation of Flutter. Dart provides the language and runtimes that power Flutter apps, but Dart also supports many core developer tasks like formatting, analyzing and testing code.

/*
Question: Explain dart.
Answer: The Dart language is type safe; it uses static type checking to ensure that a variable's static type. Sometimes, this is referred to as sound typing. Although types are mandatory, type annotations are optional because of type inference. The Dart typing system is also flexible, allowing the use of a dynamic type combined with runtime checks, which can be useful during experimentation of for code that needs to be especially dynamic.
Dart has built-in sound null safety. This means values can't be null unless you say they can be. With sound null safety, Dart can protect you form null exceptions at runtime through static code analysis. Unlike many other null-safe languages, when Dart determines that a variable is non-nullable, that variable can never be null. If you inspect your running code in the debugger, you see that non-nullability is retained at runtime; hence sound null safety.

/*
Question: Talk about dart libraries.
Answer: Dart has a rich set of core libraries, providing essentials for many everyday programming tasks:
* Built-in types, collections and other core functionality for every Dart program (dart:core)
* Richer collection types such as queues, linked lists, hashmaps and binary trees (dart:collection)
* Encoders and decoders for converting between different data representations, including JSON and UTF-8 (dart:convert)
* Mathematical constants and functions and random number generation (dart:math)
* Support for asynchronous programming, with classes such as Future an Stream(dart:async)
* Lists that efficiently handle fixed-sized data (for example, unsigned 8-byte integers) and SIMD numeric types (dart:typed_data)
